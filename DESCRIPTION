Description: SparseDOSSA 2 is an R package for fitting to and the simulation of realistic microbial
    abundance observations. It provides functionlaities for:
    a) generation of synthetic microbial observations, based on either pre-fitted template that the package provides, or user-trained results.
    b) spiking-in of associations with metadata variables or between feature pairs, for e.g. benchmarking or power analysis purposes.
    c) fitting the SparseDOSSA 2 model to real-world microbial abundance observations.
