\title{Simulate synthetic microbial abundance observations with SparseDOSSA2}
\usage{
SparseDOSSA2(
  template = "Stool",
  n_sample = 100,
  new_features = TRUE,
  n_feature = 100,
  spike_metadata = c("none", "both", "abundance", "prevalence"),
  metadata_effect_size = 1,
  perc_feature_spiked_metadata = 0.05,
  metadata_matrix = NULL,
  feature_metadata_spike_df = NULL,
  median_read_depth = 50000,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{template}{can be 1) a character string (\code{"Stool"}, \code{"Vaginal"},
or \code{"IBD"}) indicating one of the pre-trained templates in SparseDOSSA2,
or 2) user-provided, fitted results. In the latter case this should be an output
from \code{fit_SparseDOSSA2} or \code{fitCV_SparseDOSSA2}.}

\item{n_sample}{number of samples to simulate}

\item{new_features}{\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} indicator for whether or not new
features should be simulated. If \code{FALSE} then the same set of features 
in \code{template} will be simulated.}

\item{n_feature}{number of features to simulate. Only relevant when 
\code{new_features} is \code{TRUE}}

\item{spike_metadata}{character string of \code{"none"}, \code{"both"}, 
\code{"abundance"}, or \code{"prevalence"}, indicating whether or not
association with metadata will be spiked in. For the spiked-in case, it also
indicates if features' abundance/prevalence/both characteristics will be associated
with metadata}

\item{metadata_effect_size}{effect size of the spiked-in associations. This is
log fold change for abundance spike-in, and log odds ratio for prevalence spike-in}

\item{perc_feature_spiked_metadata}{percentage of features to be associated with metadata}

\item{metadata_matrix}{the user can provide a metadata matrix to use for spiking-in
of feature abundances. If using default (\code{NULL}) a single variable of balanced
cases and controls will be generated}

\item{feature_metadata_spike_df}{the user can provide a data frame to exactly prescribe
feature-metadata associations. This data frame should have exactly the following columns:
a) \code{"metadata_datum"} for which metadata to be associated with
b) \code{"feature_spiked"} which features, in
c) \code{"associated_property"} which property (\code{"abundance"}, \code{"prevalence"}, or \code{"both"}), at
d) \code{"effect_size"} what effect size. Default to \code{NULL} in which case this
data frame will be automatically generated for the user, based on \code{spike_metadata}, 
\code{metadata_effect_size}, \code{perc_feature_spiked_metadata}, and \code{metadata_matrix} (if provided).}

\item{median_read_depth}{targeted median per-sample read depth}

\item{verbose}{whether detailed information should be printed}
}
\value{
a list with the following component:
\describe{
\item{simulated_data}{
feature by sample matrix of simulated microbial count observations
}
\item{simulated_matrices}{
list of all simulated data matrices, including that of null (i.e. not spiked-in) absolute
abundances, spiked-in absolute abundances, and normalized relative abundances
}
\item{params}{
parameters used for simulation. These are provided in \code{template}.
}
\item{spike_metadata}{
list of variables provided or generated for metadata spike-in. This include 
\code{spike_metadata} for the characteristic specified (\code{"abundance"},  
\code{"prevalence"}, or \code{"both"}), \code{metadata_matrix} for the
metadata (either provided by the user or internally generated), and 
\code{feature_metadata_spike_df} (either provided by the user or internally generated) 
for detailed specification of which metadata variables were used to spike-in associations
with which features, in what properties at which effect sizes.
}
}
}
\description{
\code{SparseDOSSA2} generates synthetic microbial abundance observations
from either pre-trained template, or user-provided fitted results from
\code{fit_SparseDOSSA2} or \code{fitCV_SparseDOSSA2}. Additional options
are available for simulating associations between microbial features
and metadata variables.
}
\examples{
## Using one of the pre-trained SparseDOSSA2 templates:
sim <- SparseDOSSA2(template = "stool", n_sample = 200, new_features = FALSE)
## Using user-provided trained SparseDOSSA2 model:
data("Stool_subset")
fitted <- fit_SparseDOSSA(data = Stool_subset)
sim <- SparseDOSSA2(template = fitted, n_sample = 200, new_features = FALSE)
